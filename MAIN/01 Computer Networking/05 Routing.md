## Routing :

- Routing is a crucial aspect of networking that sends data packets from one network to another.
<br>
- In a DevOps networking context, routing ensures network traffic is routed efficiently between different networks. Below are some key points to understand routing
<br>
- Routers are the devices that perform routing in a network.
<br>
- Routers use routing tables to determine the best path for a packet.
<br>
- A routing table has network prefixes and their associated next-hop addresses. The next-hop address is the IP address of the next router on the path to the destination network.
<br>

- Routing also helps load balancing, where network traffic is distributed across multiple paths to avoid congestion and ensure smooth network operation.
<br>
- Another aspect of routing in DevOps networking is static and dynamic routing.
<br>
- In static routing, routes are manually configured and do not change unless explicitly modified.
<br>
- In dynamic routing, routing protocols automatically determine the routes based on network topology and traffic conditions, unlike static routing, where we manually configure routes.
<br>
- Routing has two types: interior routing and exterior routing.
<br>
- Interior routing protocols include OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP.
<br>
- While BGP is an example of an exterior routing protocol.
<br>
- Internet service providers use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routing information between various networks. BGP allows for dynamic routing.
<br>
- In summary, routing is a critical component of DevOps networking, as it helps determine the best path for network traffic, load balancing, and dynamic routing.
