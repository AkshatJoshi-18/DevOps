### Defination of OSI Model :
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes how data moves through a network. OSI is a layered approach that defines seven layers, each with a specific function in the communication process.

- The OSI model is crucial in DevOps networking because it provides a common reference point for network architects, engineers, and administrators to design, implement, and troubleshoot networks.


### Layer 1: Physical Layer :
- The Physical layer is the first and bottom layer of the OSI model.
- It converts data into a stream of bits and transmits them over the physical network medium.
- It defines the physical characteristics of the network, such as the type of cable, connectors, and signaling methods used to transmit data.
- This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates physical connections between network devices.
- This layer in DevOps networking uses various communication channels, including copper wires, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and fiber optic cables.
- Topologies used at this layer include point-to-point, bus, star, mesh, and ring.
- This layer uses techniques such as encoding, modulation, and error detection and correction, to minimize the effects of interference and noise.
- Some protocols used in the layer include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, and HDMI.
