# Putting the Toolbox Together

- Putting the toolbox together is all about utilizing the knowledge of DevOps networking concepts and applying it to real-world scenarios. The following are the key points to consider while putting the toolbox together:

<br>

## Understanding the network topology of your infrastructure:

- It includes identifying the devices on the network, their roles, and how they are connected.

<br>

- It is essential to have a good understanding of the network topology to troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Utilizing network monitoring tools:

- In DevOps networking, monitoring tools can provide visibility into network traffic and detect anomalies, such as traffic spikes, unusual traffic patterns, and potential security threats.

<br>

- Use tools like Nagios, Zabbix, and Cacti to monitor network performance, availability, and uptime.

<br>

## Implementing network security measures:

- DevOps networking requires implementing security measures to ensure that network resources are confidential, have integrity, and are available.

<br>

- It includes implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and virtual private networks (VPNs).

<br>

## Configuring network devices:

- In DevOps networking, devices, like routers and switches, should be configured correctly for proper functioning.

<br>

- It includes setting up VLANs, routing protocols, and access control lists (ACLs).

<br>

## Documenting the network:

- Documenting the network topology, IP addressing scheme and device configurations can help troubleshoot issues and maintain the network.

<br>

- You can use Visio, Lucidchart, and `Draw.io` to create DevOps network diagrams.
