### Circuit Switching

#### **Definition:**
Circuit switching is a method of communication where a dedicated communication path or circuit is established between two endpoints for the duration of the communication session.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

1. **Dedicated Path:**
   - A fixed path is established between the sender and receiver before communication begins.
   - The path remains dedicated to the communication session until it ends.

2. **Consistent Quality:**
   - Provides consistent and predictable performance.
   - Ensures a continuous, dedicated transmission with a guaranteed bandwidth.

3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Resources (e.g., bandwidth) are reserved and dedicated for the duration of the session, even if no data is being transmitted at times.

4. **Example Uses:**
   - Traditional telephone networks (PSTN).
   - Early long-distance communication systems.

#### **Advantages:**

- Predictable and consistent communication quality.
- Low latency once the circuit is established.
- Ideal for real-time voice and video communication.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Inefficient use of resources, as the dedicated path remains reserved even during idle periods.
- Setup time required to establish the circuit before communication can begin.
- Scalability issues due to fixed resource allocation.

### Packet Switching

#### **Definition:**
Packet switching is a method of communication where data is divided into packets and each packet is transmitted independently over the network. Packets can take different paths to reach the destination, where they are reassembled.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

1. **Data Packets:**
   - Data is broken into small packets, each with a header containing destination and sequencing information.
   - Packets are transmitted independently and can take different routes to the destination.

2. **Shared Network Resources:**
   - Network resources are shared among multiple communication sessions.
   - Packets from different sources share the same network infrastructure.

3. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Packets are routed based on the current network conditions.
   - Routers determine the optimal path for each packet.

4. **Example Uses:**
   - The Internet.
   - Local Area Networks (LANs) using Ethernet.
   - Voice over IP (VoIP).

#### **Advantages:**

- Efficient use of network resources, as bandwidth is allocated on demand.
- Scalability, as the network can handle numerous simultaneous communication sessions.
- Robustness, as packets can be rerouted in case of network congestion or failures.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Potential for variable latency and jitter, which can affect real-time applications.
- Requires sophisticated protocols for error detection, correction, and packet reassembly.
- Overhead from packet headers can reduce the effective data transmission rate.

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Path                          | Dedicated path                       | Dynamic, shared paths                 |
| Resource Allocation           | Fixed allocation, reserved for       | On-demand, shared among sessions      |
|                                 session                              |                                       |
| Efficiency                    | Less efficient (idle times)          | More efficient (no idle resources)    |
| Latency                       | Low and consistent                   | Variable, can be higher               |
| Reliability                   | High, once established               | High, but requires error handling     |
| Setup Time                    | Requires setup time                  | No setup time, faster initiation      |
| Scalability                   | Limited by fixed resources           | Highly scalable                       |
| Ideal for                     | Real-time voice, video               | Data communication, internet traffic  |

### Summary:

**Circuit Switching:** Establishes a dedicated communication path between two endpoints for the duration of the session, ensuring consistent quality and low latency but with inefficient resource utilization and scalability issues.

**Packet Switching:** Divides data into packets that are transmitted independently over a shared network, offering efficient resource use, scalability, and robustness, but with potential for variable latency and the need for complex error handling and reassembly protocols.
