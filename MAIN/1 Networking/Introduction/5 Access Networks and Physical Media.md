### Access Networks

#### **Definition:**
Access networks connect individual devices (like computers, smartphones, and IoT devices) to a larger network, typically the Internet or a private network. They serve as the first hop between end-users and the core network infrastructure.

#### **Types of Access Networks:**

1. **Wired Access Networks:**
   - **Definition:** Use physical cables to connect devices.
   - **Examples:**
     - **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):**
       - **Function:** Transmits digital data over telephone lines.
       - **Speed:** Up to 100 Mbps.
     - **Cable:**
       - **Function:** Uses coaxial cables to deliver Internet via cable TV lines.
       - **Speed:** Up to 1 Gbps or more.
     - **Fiber Optic:**
       - **Function:** Uses light signals to transmit data over glass or plastic fibers.
       - **Speed:** Up to 10 Gbps or more.
     - **Ethernet:**
       - **Function:** Standard for local area networks (LANs).
       - **Speed:** Ranges from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps.

2. **Wireless Access Networks:**
   - **Definition:** Use wireless signals to connect devices.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Wi-Fi:**
       - **Function:** Provides wireless connectivity within a limited area.
       - **Speed:** Up to several Gbps with Wi-Fi 6.
     - **Cellular Networks:**
       - **Function:** Use radio waves to connect mobile devices to the Internet.
       - **Types:** 4G LTE, 5G.
       - **Speed:** 4G up to 100 Mbps; 5G up to 10 Gbps.
     - **Satellite:**
       - **Function:** Provides Internet access via satellites.
       - **Speed:** Up to 100 Mbps or more, but with higher latency.
     - **Bluetooth:**
       - **Function:** Short-range wireless communication between devices.
       - **Speed:** Up to 3 Mbps for Bluetooth Classic, higher for newer versions.

### Physical Media

#### **Definition:**
Physical media are the physical materials used to transmit data in a network.

#### **Types of Physical Media:**

1. **Copper Cables:**
   - **Examples:**
     - **Twisted Pair:**
       - **Description:** Pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together.
       - **Types:** 
         - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** Common in Ethernet networks.
         - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):** Provides additional shielding to reduce interference.
       - **Speed:** Up to 10 Gbps with Cat6a or higher.
     - **Coaxial Cable:**
       - **Description:** Single copper conductor with insulating layer, metallic shield, and plastic cover.
       - **Use:** Cable TV and Internet.
       - **Speed:** Up to several Gbps.

2. **Fiber Optic Cables:**
   - **Description:** Uses light to transmit data through glass or plastic fibers.
   - **Types:**
     - **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):** Long-distance communication with higher bandwidth.
     - **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF):** Shorter distances with lower cost.
   - **Speed:** Up to 100 Gbps or more.
   - **Advantages:** High bandwidth, long-distance, immune to electromagnetic interference.

3. **Wireless Media:**
   - **Examples:**
     - **Radio Waves:**
       - **Use:** Wi-Fi, cellular networks, Bluetooth.
       - **Characteristics:** Travel through air, can penetrate buildings.
     - **Microwaves:**
       - **Use:** Point-to-point communication, satellite links.
       - **Characteristics:** Line-of-sight communication.
     - **Infrared:**
       - **Use:** Short-range communication, remote controls.
       - **Characteristics:** Requires direct line-of-sight.

### Summary:

**Access Networks:** Connect end-users to larger networks, using various technologies like DSL, cable, fiber optic, Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and satellite.

**Physical Media:** The materials through which data is transmitted, including copper cables (twisted pair, coaxial), fiber optic cables, and wireless media (radio waves, microwaves, infrared). Each type of physical media has its own characteristics, advantages, and applications, contributing to the overall performance and efficiency of the network.
